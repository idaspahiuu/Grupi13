	<h2>About us</h2>
	<p>
		AbcLearning is a global education initiative of Age of Learning, Inc. Our goal is to help children build a strong foundation for future academic success by providing a comprehensive and engaging online curriculum to greatly assist early learners to succeed in pre-k, kindergarten, and early elementary school programs.<br>
<br>
AbcLearning is subscription-based, with no advertising, pop-up ads, or links to other sites. Children can learn and explore with their parents, or on their own (depending on age and ability), in a safe and secure online educational environment.<br>
<br>

We named our site abcLearning because here children can learn important educational basics (often referred to as "the ABC’s") through the use of a computer mouse. At abcLearning, the computer mouse comes to life as abcLearning, who serves as our site ambassador and guide to early learners everywhere.
abcLearning’s curriculum has been designed in close collaboration with nationally recognized early childhood education experts. We are deeply grateful to the following individuals, as well as the many other education professionals who are helping us build an outstanding educational resource.

She brings to ABCmouse.com a deep and forward-thinking understanding of the role that technology should play in early childhood education. In addition to strategic curriculum planning, Ms. Burnim collaborates in the design of learning activities and other site content that are developmentally appropriate, that incorporate effective teaching strategies, and that help build a strong foundation of essential concepts and skills important for early childhood learners.
