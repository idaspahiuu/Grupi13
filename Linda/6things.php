	<h2>6 Things you should definitely do for your child</h2>
	<p><h2> Kisses and hugs </h2></p>
<p>
	Show love because love is very important for a child's emotional and spiritual development, it helps them feel loved unconditionally. Children thrive in a loving environment.



		<p><h2> Praise them</h2></p>
		<p>
			Words of affirmation go a long way in building up the child's self-esteem and confidence in trying and learning new things. Kids are as happy to receive true affirmation as much as the love you have for them, what a great job they have done, how proud you are of them, and their hard work. This can also be seen in cheering for them in sports, or even when doing normal activities, how to read. Encourage them with words like "You can do this!".


		<p><h2>Creative pursuits</h2></p>
		<p>
		Kids love to create, even if what they are painting or gluing together isnâ€™t a masterpiece. The important part is the process.

		This is one of the most important lessons to be learned, as we, grown-ups are always more result-oriented. And, amidst the race of achieving success, we forget enjoying the process and living life!
		

		<p><h2>Listen to them</h2></p>
		<p>
			Kids really want to be heard. One of the most important gifts we can give our children is the time we devote to their words. When they are upset about something they really need to be heard and it can help them calm down, making them feel heard and understood. Listening to them you will know their personalities, their needs and build their lives by encouraging the things they care about most. You will know what they are most passionate about.

		<p><h2>Take care of them, serve them</h2></p>
		<p>
			Acts of service are a language of love. Mothers and fathers serve children. But it is about serving the needs they have, when they are sick, or sad, or hurt themselves. This is instinctive for us as parents, but realizing that if this is the language of love the child will be more aware of meeting his or her emotional needs in this way.

			<p><h2>Best friends</h2></p>
		<p>
			Kids love their parents, and nothing can alter this fact. But,  at the same time, it is also true that they need people of their own age who love and accept them.

So, always encourage and help them foster friendships with other great kids.
